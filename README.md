# Smritii

Smriti `noun [s]` (**स्मृति**)  means memory, souvenir, recollection. It is
quite popular name as well. So, an additional **i** to be different... and
symbolize `plural [pl]`.

It is a personal photo album with no database - serving from a base directory.
Perfect for home use with minimal maintenance.

## Status

Early development.

## Features

* No datbase required.
* Keep metadata separate from the albums.
* Setup Once and Forget. No actions necessary for new albums and media.

... more as development progresses.

## Background / Motivation

I have tried all the top rated open source albums before arriving at decision
to implement my own. Reasons:
  * Need to incorporate database(s) that can't be managed easily. Even more
    difficult to teach folks at home.
  * Opinionated layout that either forces movement of existing files OR makes
    navigation difficult. (Agree, this visualization will be opinionated as
    well).
  * Useful features that required paid upgrade.

Of course, I did spend good time to try and contribute to some of these projects.
But, I couldn't really make any good progress locally. Got stuck every now and
then.

Main purpose is home use esp. resource constrained browsers on Smart TVs with
minimal installation effort.

For better efficiency, necessary metadata is stored at a separate location.
This data is created _on-the-go_. No scheduled jobs.

Of course, it won't have fancy features of any modern albums out there. But,
just sufficient for the purpose.
